# __Tic Tac Toe__
<br/>

### Project intructions come from [**The Odin Project**](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe-javascript).


<h4> This game is based on famous game Tic Tac Toe.</h4>


In my project you can choose, whether you want to play vs other player or computer. Computer has no logic and moves randomly. You have a score and if you reach the goal score you win and little animation will pop up showing the ultimate winner.


You can try the game yourself at <a href="https://janko12345.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe/">this page</a>
